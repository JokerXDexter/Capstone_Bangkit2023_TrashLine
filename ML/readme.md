# **Machine Learning**
# Steps to Generate Model

1. Open Google Colaboratory Notebook, specifically to [notebook](https://github.com/JokerXDexter/Capstone_Bangkit2023_TrashLine/blob/main/ML/Model/TRASHLINE_Bangkit2023-Capstone.ipynb) as the basis for implementation with Convolution Neural Network.
2. Clone the dataset and make sure it matches the directory.

3. After the training data, save the model. you can save the model in h5 file format and convert it to tensorflow lite where the .tflite extension format goes through a certain process.

# Featured Technologies
